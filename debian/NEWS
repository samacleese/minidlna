minidlna (1.2.0+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  With 1.2.0 release new option -r was introduced. It forces minidlnad to do
  soft rebuild of the database on startup. It helps in situations when data on
  disk was changed, but minidlna daemon missed this for some reason and did not
  update the database.

  I added -r option to default parameters. If your system restarts often and
  you do not need this, feel free to remove it from /etc/default/minidlna.

minidlna (1.1.6+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  With this version of minidlna new config option appears: wide_links. By
  default it's turned off and disallows access to files outside media_dirs
  even if symlinks from media_dirs point to them.

  If you have symlinks in you media_dirs (/var/lib/minidlna by default) and
  want to access them via minidlna do not forget to turn wide_links on.

  See minidlna.conf(5) or comments in config file itself for details.
